Nowadays we can’t even imagine a world without power. Even an intermittent power failure is so inconvenient. As we depend on electricity in many important areas of our life it is important to take persuasion against power failures. That’s where the inverter plays an important role. There are multiple types of inverters in the market, such as square wave inverters, modified sine wave inverters, and pure sine wave inverters. The cheapest options would be square wave and modified sine wave inverters. But the drawback is that these types of inverters are not suitable for inductive loads such as motors, fans etc. that’s where pure sine wave inverters come into play. They output a pure sinewave at line frequency. So that it won’t affect such inductive loads.
	So, in this project, we are going to build a pure sine wave inverter with ratting of 300W or 800VA. Let’s look at the components needed for this project.
